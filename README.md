# Calculator-tkinter-Python-GUI

#Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. 

This is a simple GUI based calculator that can perform basic operations(addition,subtraction,multiplication, division
(if you are python geeks then you can perform power calulation too ;) ))

It is my First GUI project on Python.
